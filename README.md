# Udacity CARND Term 3 Project 2
## Semantic Segmentation

## Creating the FCN (Fully Convolutional Network)
In this project it was necessary to create an FCN. FCNs are used to classify objects as well as identify the position of of these objects. This is particularly useful in autonomous vehicles because not only can we train a network to detect the driveable portion of the road ( as in this project) but we can also use this to identify pedestrians and other vehicles. However, one of the drawbacks could be processing time.

The FCN created is derived from.........................

The data that was use to train is the ..........................

## Examples of Tested Images
The following images show that the FCN has successfully detected the driveable portion of the road.

Here is a video example of how the FCN detects the corrects section of road.
